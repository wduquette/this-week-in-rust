# Quote of the Week

> For me, acquiring a taste for rustfmt-style seems worthwhile to 'eliminate broad classes of debate', even if I didn't like some of the style when I first looked. I've resisted the temptation to even read about how to customise.
>
> Years ago, I was that person writing style guides etc. I now prefer this problem to be automated-away; freeing up time for malloc-memcpy-golf (most popular sport in the Rust community).
